    deter sandboxes whatever repo you're in; it needs, on the HOST:
      • Docker Desktop or Podman  (auto-detected; override with DETER_DOCKER)

    Get started:
      cd ~/code/my-project
      deter init          # writes ./deter.yaml
      deter doctor        # checks docker/podman
      deter run claude    # first run builds images, then drops you into the agent
